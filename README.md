# gym-timer
This is a timer and stopwatch webpage that I created for the BJJ gym I go to. 

This is a simple interface that shows a black background with red characters. The round timer is large digits at the top with the actual time clock at the bottom, and there are buttons between the two clocks to control the timer. The round count is shown at the bottom on both sides of the time clock.

This has both a countdown timer and a stopwatch feature that are controlled by the onscreen buttons. The default action is the timer with a 60s break, however the break can be toggled between 0, 10, 45, and 60 seconds by a mouse click. The timer and stopwatch modes can be toggled by a mouse click or pressing the "T" keyboard key. In timer mode, each of the predetermined times (1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 minutes) can each be started by mouse click or by pressing the 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 0 keys on the keyboard respectively. A random timer, that randomizes each round and the break between each round based on the preset time and break durations (45 seconds and 60 seconds only), can be activated by mouseclick or by pressing the "R" key on the keyboard. A customizable timer can be set by inputting a time in MM:SS format and pressing enter in the input box. A timer can be stopped by pressing the spacebar or the "S" key on the keyboard. The entire timer can be reset by mouseclick or the "Esc" key on the keyboard.

In stopwatch mode, the stopwatch can be started and stopped by a mouseclick or by pressing the spacebar key, and can be reset by mouseclick or by pressing the "Esc" key on the keyboard.

When the timer is started for the first time, a 10 second countdown starts, and a beep will sound for the last 5 seconds with a buzzer sounding to start the round. At the end of the round, a beep will sound for the last 5 seconds with a buzzer sounding to stop the round. During the break period, a beep will sound for the last 5 seconds with a buzzer sounding to end the break/start the next round.
